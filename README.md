# rick_and_morty

The primary idea of the application is to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for interacting with the open API at https://rickandmortyapi.com.

The application consists of three main pages:
1) Character List Page: This page displays a list of all characters from the Rick and Morty series.
2) Character Details Page: Upon selecting a character, this page presents more detailed information about the chosen character.
3) Settings Page: The page where you can go to the theme changing section
